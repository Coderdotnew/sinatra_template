# coderdotnew_sinatra_template
For this template for any Sinatra applications you will build! Remember, the file structure is going to remain nearly identical, though you may want to change the `model` file names and the `view` file names to better fit the specifications of your application functionality.

Have fun building and use this template as often as you wish!  

##### Last, but not least... shout out to the real Sinatra!
